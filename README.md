# Jetpack Joyride

My project is a recreation of the original “Jetpack Joyride” game by Halfbrick. The goal is to boost your jetpack and dodge obstacles for as long as you can in a map that increases in speed and difficulty as the game goes on.

## Installation

- Install Python 3.10 (some earlier versions may work, but later versions will not). You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).

## Getting Started

1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the Repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/PinheadPatty/Jetpack-Joyride-Remake.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the Jetpack-Joyride-Remake directory:
    ```
    cd Jetpack-Joyride-Remake
    ```
4. Run the Python script:
    ```
    python3.10 JetpackJoyride.py
    ```

## Gameplay Instructions

- Click to start.
- Hold ‘space’ to boost and let go to fall.
- Zappers will scroll across the screen.
- Red missiles will give a warning and then move fast at the same height.
- Blue missiles will give a warning and then move slowly but track your y-position for half of the screen.
- Lasers will move up and down and give a warning before being activated.
- When you die, you will return to the menu, where you can see your best distance and coins (you start with 1000 coins).
- Click to unlock and equip any of the 4 gadgets/jetpacks (this will subtract money from your coin bank).
- Equipped gadgets and jetpacks will show up on the character profile on the left side, and in the game, the jetpack will be on, and the gadget displayed on the top of the screen.

## Gadgets

- Magnetism: Increases coin collection radius.
- DoubleCoins: Increases money per coin to 2.
- GravityBelt: Gravity can be flipped just by tapping ‘space’.
- PathFinder: Displays a sequence of green dots that look for a survival path.

## Replay
