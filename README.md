Jetpack Joyride
My project is a recreation of the original “Jetpack Joyride” game by ‘Halfbrick’. The goal is to boost your jetpack and dodge obstacles for as long as you can in a map that increases in speed and difficulty as the game goes on.
● Install python3.10 (some earlier versions may work, but later versions will not) ○ (use this url https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
● Open your terminal ● Clone the Repository
○ $ git clone https://github.com/PinheadPatty/Jetpack-Joyride-Remake.git ● Navigate to the Jetpack-Joyride-Remake directory
○ $ cd Jetpack-Joyride-Remake ● Run the python script
○ $ python3.10 JetpackJoyride.py
● Click to start
● You can hold ‘space’ to boost and let go to fall
● Zappers will scroll across the screen
● Red missiles will give a warning and then go fast at the same height
● Blue missiles will give a warning and then go slow but track your y position for half of the screen
● Lasers will move up and down and give a warning before being activated
● When you die, you will return to the menu, where you can see your best distance and coins (I gave you 1000 to start so you can just buy all of the gadgets/jetpacks)
● Click to unlock and equip any of the 4 gadgets/jetpacks (this will subtract money from your coin bank)
● Equipped gadgets and jetpacks will show up on the character profile on the left side, and
in game, the jetpack will be on and gadget displayed on the top of the screen
● The gadgets are:
○ ○ magnetism - increases coin collect radius
○ ○ doubleCoins - increases money per coin to 2
○ ○ gravityBelt - gravity now can be flipped just by tapping ‘space’
○ ○ pathFinder - displays a sequence of greenDots that look for a survival path
● To play the game again, simply click play again ● ENJOY!
